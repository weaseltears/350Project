This is the readme for cowboymahjong, try to keep it up to date with any information future-you will wish past-you
remembered to write down

## Project set up
This is a gradle project using JMonkey Engine and other java libraries

# Modules : 

Game module `:game` : holds `build.gradle` dependencies for the game code & should hold your code.

Desktop module `:desktop` : holds `build.gradle` for desktop dependencies & uses the `:game` module, this module can hold the desktop gui.


# Running Game : 

### Desktop : 

```gradle
./gradlew run
```


# Building Game :

### Desktop :

```bash
    $./gradlew :desktop:copyJars
```



### Distribute with a JRE

Distributing with a JRE means you'll need to provide an operating specific bundle for each OS you are
targeting (which is a disadvantage) but your end use will not have to have a JRE locally installed
(which is an advantage).

Either:

In your IDE execute the gradle task distZip (which you'll find under gradle > distributions > buildAllDistributions)

Or:

In the command line open at the root of this project enter the following command: gradlew buildAllDistributions

Then you will find a series of zip in the build/distributions folder. These zip(s) will contain your game, all the libraries to run it and an
OS specific JRE. (The same files will also be available unzipped in a folder, which may be useful if distributing via steampipe or similar).
